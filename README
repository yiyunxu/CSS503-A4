Assignment 4
Elaine Xu

For this assignment, our task it to implement a class-based version of Remote 
Procedure Call that communicate between a client and server in a distributed 
application. The client will send request to server and server will perform the 
system calls. The RPC implementation hides the details that allow communication 
to take place from the user. The user will act as calling the regular methods.


Assignment 2 Sleeping Barbers uses IPC (inter process communicaton) which all 
happens on one machine, where memory is shared. Signals are sent to check and 
write to the shared mutex memory directly (barber and customer state). In 
Assignment 4, RPC (remote process call) is capale of passing message over the 
wire to a different computer, and has no shared memory at all. The messgae 
passed in RPC needs to be well structured and contains an identifier to the 
function to execute and the parameter to pass to that function. Then the sever 
needs to send back the output to client in a separate message using the same 
message passing system.


When multiple clients make RPC requests at the same time, the requests could be 
carried out concurrently by implementing multiple threads on the server side. 
Every connection will spawn a thread that runs its RPC calls. If one thread is 
trying to modify an already in-use file by a different thread, an error would 
occur.
